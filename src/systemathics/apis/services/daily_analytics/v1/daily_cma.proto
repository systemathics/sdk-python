// Moving averages smooth the price movements by filtering out the "noise" caused by short-term price fluctuations. 
// <br>They also form the building blocks for a wide range of technical indicators. Computing moving averages over a defined number of time periods is useful to:
// <br>- identify the trend direction
// <br>- determine support and resistance levels
// <br>CMA is the average of all the data points.
