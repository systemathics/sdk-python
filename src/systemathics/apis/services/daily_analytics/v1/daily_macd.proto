// <i>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence Oscillator</i> was developed by Gerald Appel and represents the difference between two moving averages of different lengths.
// <br>As its name implies, MACD is all about convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. MACD oscilaltes around the zero line as follows:
// <br>- positive values increase as the shorter moving average diverges further from the longer one
// <br>- negative values indicate that the shorter moving average is below the longer one
// <br><br>MACD is computed as follows: $$ MACD = short EMA - long EMA $$
