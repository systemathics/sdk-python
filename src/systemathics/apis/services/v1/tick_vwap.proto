// <i>The Volume Weighted Average Price</i> is similar to a moving average, except volume is included to weight the average price over a one trading day period.
// <br>It serves as a reference point for one trading day prices. Comparing current prices with the VWAP values enables to:
// <br>- mesure trading efficiency by comparing individual trades to VWAP
// <br>- highlight liquidity points as vwap reflects prices levels weighted by volume
// <br>- determine the market trend, etc.
