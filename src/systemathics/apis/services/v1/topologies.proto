// Tick count can be used as an indicator to illustrate market activity by computing the technical transactions/transmissions count on a tick by tick basis.
// <br>It represents a valuable technical indicator to monitor tick by tick data reception. Building a history of tick count can be useful to:
// <br>- guarantee tick by tick data good reception and completion
// <br>- compare trading periods and highlight high-level of activity periods
// <br>- combined with other indicators, it helps to optimal future rolling, etc.
// <br>Correlated with of other indicators such as traded volume and count of trades, over the same look back period, it repserents a good measurement of the market quality.
